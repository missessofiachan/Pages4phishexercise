            <p>Dear User,</p>
            <p>As part of Empire Company's commitment to cybersecurity, we conducted a controlled phishing simulation. Your information remains safe. Below are tips on how to avoid phishing attacks and protect your personal information:</p>
            
            <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>Phishing is a cyber attack that uses disguised emails to trick you into revealing personal information. Attackers often impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.</p>

            <h2>How to Identify Phishing Emails</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Suspicious Sender:</strong> Verify the sender’s email address. Phishing emails often use addresses that resemble legitimate ones but have slight variations.</li>
                <li><strong>Urgent Language:</strong> Be wary of emails that create a sense of urgency or pressure you to act quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Generic Greetings:</strong> Phishing emails often use generic salutations like “Dear Customer” instead of your name.</li>
                <li><strong>Links and Attachments:</strong> Hover over links to check their true destination before clicking. Avoid downloading attachments from unknown sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Grammar:</strong> Many phishing emails contain spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps to Prevent Phishing Attacks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verify Requests:</strong> Contact the company directly using contact details from their official website, not the information provided in the email.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enable MFA to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Update Software:</strong> Keep your software and anti-virus programs up to date to protect against the latest threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Stay informed about the latest phishing tactics and how to spot them.</li>
                <li><strong>Report Phishing:</strong> Report suspicious emails to your IT department or use the reporting tools provided by your email service.</li>
            </ul>
